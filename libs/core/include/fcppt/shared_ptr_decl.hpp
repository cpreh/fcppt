\brief A shared pointer class that gets the deleter as a template parameter

\ingroup fcpptsmartptr

A shared pointer shares ownership of a single pointer with other shared
pointers. How many shared pointers actually own a pointer is kept track of as a
reference count. Copying shared pointers increases the count by one, while
destroying shared pointers decrases the count by one. If the count reaches
zero, the object that is pointed to will be destroyed.

The class is implemented using <code>std::shared_ptr</code>, so it will inherit
most of its traits. This means that the class also uses type erasure for its
deleter and internal ref count.

\tparam Type The type the shared pointer points to

\tparam Deleter A deleter class that must be callable with a pointer to Type.
