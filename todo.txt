- Look for better codecvt implementation
- Replace static_assert/enable_if by Concepts if possible
- Use = default for operator==
- Use C++20's ranges (not implemented in libc++)
- Allow std::uint8_t enums in random distributions
- Clean up fcppt::algorithm code to work with all ranges if possible
- test/container/grid/object.cpp:34:9: warning: use a boost version of this algorithm [boost-use-ranges]
- test/container/grid/object.cpp:85:9: warning: use a boost version of this algorithm [boost-use-ranges]
- Test for FCPPT_PP_STRINGIZE
